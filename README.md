# Fastify + Lit + Rollup Boilerplate**

A fast and efficient foundation for building web applications using
* **Fastify:** A high-performance Node.js web framework for efficiency.
* **Lit:** A lightweight library from Google for building reactive web components.
* **Rollup:** Powerful JavaScript module bundler for optimized production builds.

## Features

* **Rapid Development:** Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for immediate development feedback.
* **Lean Components:** Lit provides efficient, declarative web component creation.
* **Optimized Builds:** Rollup minimizes code size and maximizes performance for production.
* **Clear Structure:** A well-organized project layout promotes maintainability.
* **TypeScript Support:** Optional typing for greater code safety and clarity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fastify-lit-rollup-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Copy `.env.exaple` and name to `.env`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Building for Production

1. Generate a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The optimized build is located in the `dist` folder.  

## Customization

* Adapt the project structure to match your preferences.
* Extend with additional libraries or tools as needed.
* Configure Fastify routes and endpoints.
* Create rich and interactive Lit-based web components.
